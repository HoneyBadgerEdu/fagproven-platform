question: "A 34-year-old woman has had paroxysmal palpitations for 5 years. Otherwise, she is healthy. She now comes to you at the emergency room with an ongoing attack and you manage to take an ECG just before it subsides on its own. This is presented below and you find the beginning of the P-wave 60 ms after the start of the QRS complex. The ventricular rate is 190/min. What is the most likely arrhythmia diagnosis?"
answer0: "Atrial tachycardia"
explanation0: "Atrial tachycardia is a theoretically possible diagnosis, but then the PR interval must be almost as long as the RR distance and the focus is located low in the atria. This is unlikely."
answer1: "Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT)"
explanation1: "Correct answer. It is typical for AVNRT that the P-wave comes just after the QRS (<70 ms) and that it is negative in II, III, and aVF because the atria are activated from below."
answer2: "Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT)"
explanation2: "In AVRT, the P-wave practically always comes > 70 ms after the QRS."
answer3: "Atrial flutter"
explanation3: "In atrial flutter, the atrial rate is usually between 240 and 320/min with more P-waves than QRS. The ventricular rate does not fit either with a 1:1 block or 2:1 block."
